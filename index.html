        <p class="lead mb-4"> I was born and raised in Anaheim, California and moved out to Corona last year. I lived with my mother, father, and three brothers. We lived in a small two bedroom apartment, but always made it work. My parents were very traditional Mexican parents so I grew up disciplined and respectful. I overall did well in school, usually at the top of my class. I kept this up even throughout high school as I began taking honor and AP classes. <br><br>

        In high school, I tried to keep myself active outside of just school work. I was in the marching band all four years and each year I worked harder to continue moving up in the leadership positions. I was part of the band council as president, and became the section leader for my instrument. It took a lot of time and dedication to compete with others to earn that position. I was able to develop leadership skills throughout this experience. I was able to resolve conflict, plan and hold events, run meetings, and so much more. It helped as I continued to develop in a work setting as I was learning how to speak in a way that was assertive yet respectful.  <br><br>

        Aside from school activities, I also began to work at the age of sixteen. I had to manage my time to be able to participate in it all and still stay on top of my work. I stayed at the same place for about two years, but due to COVID, it shut down and I had to switch jobs. I worked at Target for about three months until I moved to Corona and luckily found a job after about a month of moving. I've been there for almost a year now and have had the fortune of working in different departments. I've moved up and just began my newest position. I also had the great pleasure of beginning my first year at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently in my second quarter studying as an education, human and societal development major. I've begun with my core classes and have learned about the development of the education system. The other classes I have taken have begun to prepare me for several other items such as public speaking or building a resume.
